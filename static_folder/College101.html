    <div id = "pickCollege">

    <p> When picking a college, it is important to take a look at the campus, majors/minors offered, and tuition. However,
      it is vital to never settle for a school based on acceptance; just because students are accepted does not mean
      they must attend. Follow your heart and logic when it comes to picking a college, or you might be in a place
      you dislike (but don't worry, you have our advice to guide you). If possible, try to visit the colleges you are interested in
      so you get a good feeling of what campus and student life is like.</p>

  <button class = "slider" onclick="slideMajor()"><h2> Picking a Major </h2></button>
  <div id = "pickMajor">
  <p> Have no idea what you want to study? That's okay!
     You do not have to know right away; some schools even encourage students to
     wait until their second year to declare a major. The best thing to do in
     this situation is to find the intersection between your passions and your skills. This means taking classes
     on subjects you find interesting and joining different clubs in order to experience a variety of fields.
     Students can always change their major. </p>

  <h3>What is Financial Aid? </h3>
  <p>Financial aid is money that can help students pay for college tuition.
     There are different types of aid students can receive; loans require payment at a later time and scholarships
     and grants are free money. </p>
  <h3>Importance of Financial Aid</h3>
  <p> Financial aid is important because it allows students to attend college affordably. In fact,
  students who consider their dream schools too expensive can usually receive financial aid to help with tuition costs.</p>
  <h3> How do I get Financial Aid? </h3>
  <p> The process for applying for financial aid may be overwhelming, but take it slow: everything will be okay.<br>
      You can get financial aid through the federal government, state governments, your college,
      and private organizations. In order to access this money you have to APPLY!   </p>
  <p> Start with applying for FAFSA (linked below). By doing so you can gain access to grants/scholarships, work study jobs, and government loans
  that you usually will be able to pay back after graduation. Next, apply for any state financial aid (i.e. Cal Grant) and make sure your school sends your transcript to
  the financial aid office. Then start looking for and applying to as many external (other websites listed below) scholarships as possible.</p>
<h2>Scholarships</h2>
  <h3>Why should I apply for scholarships? </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>College costs a lot of money and tuition keeps increasing.</li>
    <li> Not every family can afford to help pay college costs </li>
  <li> It may be painful to leave college with immense debt. </li>
    <li>They are free to apply to and can cover tuition costs that financial aid from the government and your school
  many not. </li>
</ol>
