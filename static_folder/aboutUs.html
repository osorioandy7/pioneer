  <h2>Andy Osorio</h2>
  <p>Hello, Andy here. I worked on the back end of the application alongside Rebecca. I, as a first generation
    college student, feel that knowledge
    is key to understanding what it means to pursue higher education. I know I had no idea what
     I was doing when I was introduced into the idea of college. My mom had little to no education so
     I had to rely on the staff of my high school to help me out with the entire concept of college. I am
     passionate about this project because I believe it can provide an opportunity to other students who are
     in the same position I was once in. I hope that this project paves a way for aspiring first generation
     college students in the future.  </p>

  <p> Hola, yo soy Denise! This website means the world to
    me because both my parents never went to college or attempted it, however,
    I am so fortunate to have my older brother to guide me through the college process.
    I know not everyone has that same resource so through this incredible process we've worked side by side
    to show you the way through the applying process of college. Let us be your pioneers.</p>

  <h2> Rebecca Zeng</h2>
  <p> Hi! My name is Rebecca, and I worked on the forum backend and Google App Engine elements
    of this project. I am a first generation college student; my parents arrived in the U.S. with
    virtually neither money nor English skills, so I owe everything I do to their diligence and dedication
    to my future when I was growing up. Aside from studying computer science languages, I also passionately
    desire exposure to world languages in an attempt to learn more about different cultures and human interactions.
    Ultimately, this project enabled me to learn from others and utilize my own knowledge in order to benefit other first
    generation college students.</p>
